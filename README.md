## 1. Overview

Week 2 focuses on building a **solid understanding of SoC fundamentals** and hands-on experience with **functional modelling** using the BabySoC.  

Key learning objectives:  

- Understand the architecture and components of a System-on-Chip (SoC)  
- Explore CPU, Memory, and Peripheral interactions  
- Practice functional simulation using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**  
- Document observations using waveform analysis  

This week is divided into **two parts**: conceptual theory and hands-on labs.

## 2. Part 1: Conceptual Understanding

**Objective:** Learn the theory behind SoC design and BabySoC.  

**Contents:**  

- What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?  
- Components of a typical SoC: CPU, Memory, Peripherals, Bus, Clock & Reset  
- Why BabySoC is a simplified learning model  
- Role of functional modelling before RTL and physical design  
- Summary and conceptual deliverables  

**Deliverable:** Markdown file summarizing all the theory with diagrams and explanations.

## 3. Part 2: Hands-on Functional Modelling

**Objective:** Practice functional modelling of BabySoC modules and analyze waveforms.  

**Contents:**  

- Compilation of BabySoC Verilog files using Icarus Verilog  
- Simulation and generation of `.vcd` waveform files  
- Analysis of reset, clock, and dataflow between CPU, Memory, and Peripheral  
- Observations and screenshots of waveforms  
- Simulation logs and conclusions  

**Deliverables:**  

- Simulation logs  
- GTKWave screenshots with observations  
- README documenting each screenshot and analysis
