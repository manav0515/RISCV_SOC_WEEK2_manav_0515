## 1. What is a System-On-Chip(SOC) ?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that consolidates all the essential components of a computing systemâ€”such as a processor core, memory, input/output interfaces, and control logicâ€”onto a **single silicon die**.  

Unlike traditional systems where these components exist on separate boards or chips, an SoC offers **compactness, high performance, low power consumption, and reduced communication delay**.  

SoCs are found in almost every modern device including **smartphones, IoT sensors, routers, and embedded controllers**. They represent the convergence of **hardware, firmware, and communication subsystems** into one integrated chip.

## 2. Components of a Typical SoC

A typical SoC consists of multiple blocks that communicate through standardized interconnects:

### **a. Processor / CPU Core**
- The **brain** of the SoC.  
- Executes instructions, handles control signals, and manages system-level tasks.  
- Common architectures: **RISC-V**, **ARM**, or **MIPS**.  
- Includes ALU, control unit, and internal registers.

### **b. Memory Subsystem**
- Stores instructions and data for the CPU.  
- Divided into:  
  - **Volatile memory (SRAM, DRAM)** â€“ for temporary runtime data.  
  - **Non-volatile memory (ROM, Flash)** â€“ for permanent firmware and boot programs.

### **c. Peripherals**
- Provide interfaces to the external world.  
- Examples: **UART**, **SPI**, **I2C**, **Timers**, **GPIOs**, **ADC/DACs**.  
- Enable communication with external sensors and devices.

### **d. Interconnect / Bus System**
- Acts as the **communication backbone** of the SoC.  
- Ensures smooth data transfer between CPU, memory, and peripherals.  
- Common bus standards: **AMBA (AHB/APB)** and **Wishbone**.  
- Handles arbitration, timing, and bandwidth sharing.

### **e. Clock and Reset Circuits**
- **Clock** provides the timing reference for synchronous operations.  
- **Reset** initializes all modules into a known startup state.

## 3. Why BabySoC is a Simplified Learning Model

The **BabySoC** used in the VSD Journey is a **simplified representation** of a real-world SoC, designed for educational and functional understanding rather than complexity.  

**Key reasons itâ€™s ideal for learning:**
- Demonstrates how CPU, memory, and peripherals interact through buses.  
- Avoids the overhead of complex instruction pipelines and multi-core setups.  
- Easy to simulate using **open-source tools (Icarus Verilog, GTKWave)**.  
- Encourages experimentation with resets, clocks, and signal dataflow.  

The BabySoC thus helps students **visualize SoC-level interactions** and **build confidence** before diving into advanced RTL or physical design topics.

## 4. Role of Functional Modelling in SoC Design Flow

**Functional Modelling** is performed **before RTL and physical design** stages.  
Its main goal is to ensure that all blocks behave correctly as per the architecture specification.

### **Purpose:**
- Validate the **logical behavior** of modules.  
- Detect design or communication errors **early** in the flow.  
- Visualize **waveforms** to study clock, reset, and data movement.  
- Build confidence in the SoC structure before committing to synthesis.

### **Tools Used:**
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** Compiles and simulates Verilog designs.  
- **GTKWave:** Displays `.vcd` (Value Change Dump) files to view signal transitions.  

**Example Workflow:**
1. Compile BabySoC Verilog modules with `iverilog`.  
2. Run simulation to generate waveform output.  
3. Analyze the `.vcd` file using `gtkwave` for reset, clock, and data signals.  

Functional Modelling acts as a **bridge** between SoC theory and hands-on design implementation, ensuring that your architecture performs logically correct before moving to synthesis and layout.

## 5. Summary

The **BabySoC project** provides a practical environment to understand:
- SoC architecture hierarchy (CPU, memory, peripherals).  
- Signal communication and synchronization.  
- The significance of **early functional verification** using open-source EDA tools.  

By mastering BabySoC, learners gain a strong foundation for progressing into **RTL design**, **synthesis**, and **physical design**, completing the end-to-end SoC learning cycle.
